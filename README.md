Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Classification
Overview
This project aims to classify chest X-ray images into pneumonia and normal classes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The dataset used for this task is sourced from Kaggle's Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset.

Dataset
The dataset consists of two main classes:

Pneumonia: Chest X-ray images of patients diagnosed with pneumonia.
Normal: Chest X-ray images of healthy individuals without pneumonia.
Data Directory Structure
After downloading and organizing the dataset, the directory structure should look like this:

Evaluation Metrics
The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified images.
Loss: Cross-entropy loss between predicted and actual labels.
Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
Findings
Model Architecture: Implemented a CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers.
Training: Trained the model using augmented data from the train/ directory.
Evaluation: Achieved a test accuracy of approximately 85% after 10 epochs.
Next Steps: Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and consider additional data augmentation techniques.
